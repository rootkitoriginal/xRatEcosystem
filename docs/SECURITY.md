## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed

**Report via:**
- **Email:** security@xrat-ecosystem.com (future)
- **GitHub Security Advisory:** Use the "Security" tab on GitHub
- **Private message:** Contact maintainers directly

### What to Include

Please provide:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 24-48 hours
  - High: Within 7 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Next regular release

### Disclosure Policy

We follow **responsible disclosure**:

1. Security issue reported to maintainers
2. Maintainers confirm and assess severity
3. Fix is developed and tested
4. Security advisory is published
5. Fix is released
6. Public disclosure after users have time to update (typically 7-14 days)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

**DO:**
- Store secrets in `.env` file (never commit!)
- Use strong, randomly generated passwords
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use different credentials for each environment

**DON'T:**
- Commit `.env` files to Git
- Hardcode secrets in source code
- Share credentials via insecure channels
- Use default or weak passwords

**Example:**
```bash
# Good
MONGODB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)

# Bad
MONGODB_PASSWORD=password123
REDIS_PASSWORD=redis
JWT_SECRET=mysecret
```

### Database Security

**MongoDB:**
- Enable authentication (required in production)
- Use strong passwords
- Limit network access (internal only)
- Enable audit logging
- Regular backups
- Keep MongoDB updated

```bash
# MongoDB with authentication
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:strong_password@mongo:27017/xrat?authSource=admin
```

**Redis:**
- Require password authentication
- Bind to localhost/internal network only
- Disable dangerous commands in production
- Enable persistence for important data
- Regular backups

```bash
# Redis configuration
requirepass your_strong_password
bind 127.0.0.1
rename-command FLUSHDB ""
rename-command FLUSHALL ""
```

### Network Security

**Docker Network Isolation:**
- MongoDB and Redis are NOT exposed to host
- Only Backend (3000) and Frontend (5173) ports are exposed
- All internal communication via Docker network

**Production Recommendations:**
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all external connections
- Implement reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)
- Configure firewall rules
- Use VPN for administrative access
- Implement DDoS protection

### Application Security

**Backend:**
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Parameterized queries (prevent SQL/NoSQL injection)
- Rate limiting (future)
- CORS configuration
- Security headers (Helmet.js)
- Request size limits
- JWT for authentication (future)

**Frontend:**
- Sanitize user input
- Implement CSP (Content Security Policy)
- Avoid inline scripts
- Validate data from API
- Secure cookie settings (future)

### Container Security

**Current:**
- Use official Docker images
- Regular security updates
- Volume-mounted data for persistence

**Future Improvements:**
- Run containers as non-root user
- Read-only root filesystem
- Drop unnecessary capabilities
- Use security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- Implement resource limits

### Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Security audits: `npm audit`
- Use lock files (package-lock.json)
- Review dependency licenses
- Minimize dependencies

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm audit
cd backend && npm audit
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Current Implementation

#### Helmet.js Security Headers

The backend uses Helmet.js to set secure HTTP headers:

```javascript
app.use(helmet());
```

**Headers set:**
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`
- `X-Frame-Options`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`
- `X-Download-Options`
- `X-Content-Type-Options`
- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`

#### CORS Configuration

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:5173',
  credentials: true
}));
```

#### Request Compression

Reduces bandwidth usage and improves performance:

```javascript
app.use(compression());
```

#### Input Validation

All API endpoints validate required fields:

```javascript
if (!key || !value) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Key and value are required'
  });
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### Development vs Production

**Development Mode:**
- Detailed error messages exposed
- Debug logging enabled
- No authentication required
- CORS accepts localhost

**Production Mode:**
- Generic error messages
- Minimal logging
- Authentication required (future)
- CORS restricted to specific domains

### Current Limitations

1. **No Authentication:** API endpoints are currently public
   - **Mitigation:** Implement JWT authentication
   - **Timeline:** Phase 3

2. **No Rate Limiting:** Susceptible to brute force and DoS
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting middleware
   - **Timeline:** Phase 3

3. **MongoDB & Redis Access:** Exposed on Docker network
   - **Mitigation:** Already isolated from host
   - **Note:** This is acceptable for containerized deployments

4. **No Encryption at Rest:** Data stored unencrypted
   - **Mitigation:** Implement database encryption
   - **Timeline:** Phase 4

5. **No Audit Logging:** Limited security event tracking
   - **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive audit logging
   - **Timeline:** Phase 3
